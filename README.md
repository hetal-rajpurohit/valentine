# Valentine Webpage 💖

This is a simple Valentine-themed webpage created using HTML and CSS.

The page includes:
- A cute design layout
- "Yes" button that redirects to another page
- A fun moving "No" button using CSS hover effect

This project helped me practice HTML structure, CSS styling, positioning, and basic interactive effects without using JavaScript.

Made with creativity and love 💕
